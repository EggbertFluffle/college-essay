These included touch typing proficiency, 3D modeling with Autodesk Inventor, and even an introduction to creating web pages using HTML using the Atom text editor. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the class, the bell always rang too soon, leaving me craving more. Mr. Gerdes never had enough curriculum to give me, so I took it upon myself to quench this thirst and started by poking around the computers in the lab.

The only problem was, I didn't know any code.
